Polar Software License Agreement

The enclosed software, including, but not limited to, one or more of
the following: source code, object code, dynamic link libraries,
static libraries, header files, sample programs, utility programs,
Makefiles and scripts, together with the accompanying documentation
(collectively known as the "Software") is owned by Polar or its

treaties.  Therefore, you must treat the Software like any copyrighted
material (e.g., a book or musical recording) except that you may make 
either (a) one backup copy of the Software solely for backup purposes,
or (b) transfer the Software to a hard disk and keep the original 
copy solely for backup purposes.

Polar grants to you (one software programmer) the limited
right to use only one copy of the Software on a single computer
(typically one personal computer) in the manner set forth in this
agreement.  Each Software Programmer must have his or her own license
to use the Software.

Subject to the restrictions contained in this agreement, you MAY:

a) Incorporate the dynamic link libraries and statically linked
libraries into software application products that you develop.

b) Modify (i.e. modify the source code and rebuild) the dynamic link
libraries and statically linked libraries and incorporate the modified
dynamic link libraries and statically linked libraries into software 
application products that you develop.

c) Make and distribute copies of the dynamic link libraries and
statically linked libraries of the Software as incorporated into
software application products that you develop provided that the
Software, or other Polar products, do not constitute a major portion 
of the value of your product.

d) Use and modify the source code version of those portions of the
Software that are identified in the documentation as the Sample Code
("SAMPLE CODE"), provided you do not distribute the SAMPLE CODE, or
any modified version of the SAMPLE CODE, in source code form.

Notwithstanding any provisions in this agreement to the contrary, you
may NOT:

a) Distribute in any manner any of the header files, source code,
SAMPLE CODE, Makefiles, object modules or independent static libraries
of the Software.

b) Make telecommunication transmittal of the Software.

c) Distribute any portion of the Software or any derivative of any
portion of the Software in a software development product or otherwise
in competition with Polar's distribution of the Software.

d) Disclose any source codes of the Software to any person or entity.


The source codes of the Software are valuable assets of Polar.
You agree to keep all source codes of the Software in confidence.  
You may not transfer or assign the Software or your rights under 
this agreement.
