# Polar TFIDF
Polar TFIDF is a C# library for dealing with document keywords.  
TFIDF stands for [term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf). It's a way of calculating the singificance that each keyword has in a given document. It's useful for document searching by a keyword or for getting similar documents of a particular document.  
Polar TFIDF uses an embedded database so larger amount of data can be processed.
